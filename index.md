Hello, and welcome to my newly-made webpage. I am a Computer Science PhD Student at the [Digital Humanities Laboratory (DHLAB)](http://dhlab.epfl.ch/) at [EPFL](http://epfl.ch/), under the supervision of Prof. Frédéric Kaplan.

In the future, I will share here the details of the [Replica Project](http://dhlab.epfl.ch/page-128334-en.html) which is the focal point of my thesis, but I sometimes might make off-topic posts about programming tricks or anything else really...
