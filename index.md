I am a Computer Science PhD Student at the [Digital Humanities Laboratory (DHLAB)](http://dhlab.epfl.ch/) at [EPFL](http://epfl.ch/), under the supervision of Prof. Frédéric Kaplan.

My thesis is based on the [Replica Project](http://dhlab.epfl.ch/page-128334-en.html) where I use machine learning and modern image searching algorithm to help Art Historians navigate very large iconographic collections.
