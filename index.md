Greetings!

I am an Independent Engineer specialized in the applications of Machine Learning.

While being rather polyvalent and actually coming from a theoritical background, I have a specific expertise with applying technology to large data coming from the Cultural Heritage domain.

I successfully [defended my PhD thesis](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/congrats-to-dr-benoit-seguin-2/) at the end of last year. During these few years, I got the opportunity to be involved with (and often directly be responsible of) every step of a successful Digital Humanities project, from the raw scanned documents to the interaction with the end users, directly designing state-of-the-art Machine Learning based algorithms to enrich the Terabytes of initial data, or prototyping novel navigation methods.

Some of my publications are linked directly on the [research page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link research.md %}).

Feel free to contact me if you feel I could bring value to your project!
