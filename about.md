My name is Benoit Seguin and I am an Independent Engineer specialized in the applications of Machine Learning, especially to the domain of Cultural Heritage.

I was a PhD student at the [Digital Humanities Laboratory (DHLAB)](http://dhlab.epfl.ch/) at [EPFL](http://epfl.ch/). My thesis was based on the [Replica Project](http://dhlab.epfl.ch/page-128334-en.html) where I used machine learning and modern image processing to help Art Historians navigate very large iconographic collections.

I received a _Diplôme d'Ingénieur_  from [École Polytechnique (Paris)](http://www.polytechnique.edu/), and a _Master of Science_ as well as my _PhD_ from [EPFL](http://epfl.ch/).

My complete resume can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/Resume.pdf).
