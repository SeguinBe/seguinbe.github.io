My name is Benoit Seguin and I am a PhD student at the [Digital Humanities Laboratory (DHLAB)](http://dhlab.epfl.ch/) at [EPFL](http://epfl.ch/). My main interests are Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Image Processing.

My thesis is based on the [Replica Project](http://dhlab.epfl.ch/page-128334-en.html) where I use machine learning and modern image searching algorithm to help Art Historians navigate very large iconographic collections.

I received a _Master of Science_ from [EPFL](http://epfl.ch/) and a _Diplôme d'Ingénieur_ from [École Polytechnique](http://www.polytechnique.edu/). My complete resume can be found [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14341018/Resume.pdf).
